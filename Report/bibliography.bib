abstract = "It is important to understand and forecast a typical or a particularly household daily consumption in order to design and size suitable renewable energy systems and energy storage. In this research for Short Term Load Forecasting (STLF) it has been used Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and, despite the consumption unpredictability, it has been shown the possibility to forecast the electricity consumption of a household with certainty. The ANNs are recognized to be a potential methodology for modeling hourly and daily energy consumption and load forecasting. Input variables such as apartment area, numbers of occupants, electrical appliance consumption and Boolean inputs as hourly meter system were considered. Furthermore, the investigation carried out aims to define an ANN architecture and a training algorithm in order to achieve a robust model to be used in forecasting energy consumption in a typical household. It was observed that a feed-forward ANN and the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm provided a good performance. For this research it was used a database with consumption records, logged in 93 real households, in Lisbon, Portugal, between February 2000 and July 2001, including both weekdays and weekend. The results show that the ANN approach provides a reliable model for forecasting household electric energy consumption and load profile."

	title = {Predicting residential electricity consumption using neural networks: A case study},
	journal = {Journal of Physics: Conference Series},
	abstract = {Electricity demand prediction plays an essential role in short-term load allocation and long-term planning for new generation and transmission infrastructures. An accurate prediction also allows to take better decisions in terms of cost and energy efficiency. In this aspect, this paper proposes a model for predicting the electricity consumption of residential area in Seoul using neural network. This work has analyzed several particular characteristics of the aforementioned city to extract variables that could have direct influence in the electricity consumption pattern. Using the extracted variables, this paper could forecast the residential electricity consumption with an average error rate of 2.0375% and it could demonstrate how the elderly population is the parameter that influences with major weight at the moment of forecasting residential electricity consumption. Additionally, the presented work illustrates how executing the supervised learning process using a data set organized by months of the year can reduce considerably the error rate. Furthermore, the analysis or results delivers interesting findings related to the energy consumption in Seoul.}

abstract = "This paper presents and discusses data-driven predictive models for the energy use of appliances. Data used include measurements of temperature and humidity sensors from a wireless network, weather from a nearby airport station and recorded energy use of lighting fixtures. The paper discusses data filtering to remove non-predictive parameters and feature ranking. Four statistical models were trained with repeated cross validation and evaluated in a testing set: (a) multiple linear regression, (b) support vector machine with radial kernel, (c) random forest and (d) gradient boosting machines (GBM). The best model (GBM) was able to explain 97% of the variance (R2) in the training set and with 57% in the testing set when using all the predictors. From the wireless network, the data from the kitchen, laundry and living room were ranked the highest in importance for the energy prediction. The prediction models with only the weather data, selected the atmospheric pressure (which is correlated to wind speed) as the most relevant weather data variable in the prediction. Therefore, atmospheric pressure may be important to include in energy prediction models and for building performance modeling."
